## RSA Cipher ##
This is a simple block cipher called RSA. This RSA is done using a digital signature scheme. You can run the code using:

1. Download Python and Python Debugger
2. Run this command in your terminal
    ```
   python rsa.py
    ```
   
You should see results for the current example numbers that are in the code already.

Thank you for viewing my project!
